# Learning Backtesting with Python

A personal project exploring financial backtesting using:
- 📈 `yfinance` for market data
- 📊 `mplfinance` for visualization
- ⚙️ `backtrader` for strategy backtesting

## What's This About?

This is my learning playground for understanding how to:
1. Fetch stock data using `yfinance`
2. Visualize financial data with `mplfinance`
3. Build and test simple trading strategies with `backtrader`
